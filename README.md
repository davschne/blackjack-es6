# ECMAScript 6 Blackjack

This simple version of Blackjack is a demonstration piece for some of the new language features in ECMAScript 6, including

  - class definitions
  - class "inheritance"
  - generator functions
  - arrow functions
  - Promises
  - block-scope binding
  - template strings
  - default arguments
  - tail-recursion optimization

The game is run from the command line. It can take a single argument, the number of 52-card decks to use for the game. All user prompts during the game use asynchronous functions.
